## What is it?
Pages of Mages is a 2D deckbuilding video game where players use a variety of spells in order to control avatars and win in a 1 on 1 combat. Made using unity 2020.3.30f1. 

## Where is the code at?
The code, and all other assets that I made can be found under Pages-of-Mages/Assets

## What state is it in right now?
Currently, Pages of Mages is heavily in developpement. Pass&Play combat is currently *playable*, however due to issues with animation timing and a serious lack of card diversity it is not particularly fun. 
Completed goals:
- Functional deck saving
- Pass & Play is playable
- Lobby and pause menu's work

Todo:
- Add bots for Play vs. Bots
- Fix issues with actions occuring after animations and players possibly clicking too fast
- Implement deck import and export system
- Add cards and characters
- Spriting
